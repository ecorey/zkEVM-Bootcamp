# Homework 8

**[Polynomial](https://www.zkcamp.xyz/blog/you-cant-understand-zkps-without-understanding-polynomials) practice**

- for p(x) = x^3 − 5x^2 − 4x + 20

  - a) find an integer root a , i.e. p(a) = 0 (clue a < 7)

    - p(x)=0
    - −2, 2, 5

  - b) write this in terms of a lower degree polynomial q(x)
    such as p(x) = (x − a)q(x)

  - What are the degrees of p(x) and q(x) ?

_Note we are doing this over the real numbers, for zkps we would use a finite
field_
