# Homework 15

**Arkworks R1CS tutorial part 1**
**Work through the Merkle Tree tutorial**
*You will need to clone the repo or setup a codespace. We will work through this in stages, initially we look at the normal implementation of a merkle tree outside a circuit, then will implement this in a circuit. At this stage we just need to familiarise ourselves with the code and the process.*

**Part 1 - API without constraints**

- Look at the test code in lib.rs

- see function test_merkle_tree()

    - Line 40 creates a simple tree. There are 2 types of hash functions
    CRH is used for a Leaf Hash. 
    - a single hash TwoToOneCRH is used to hash pairs
