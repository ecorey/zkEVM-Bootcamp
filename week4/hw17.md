# Homework 17 

**Stark Arithmetisation**

- Using the notation Ai,j to refer to the value in cell for row i, column j
- Write as many boundary and line constraints as you can for a program designed as follows :

    - Column 1 is the row, column 2 is an increment, column 3 is an accumulator.
    - At each step we add the increment value to the accumulator.
    - The starting values for the accumulator and increment are 0.
    - The increment is always positive and less than 10.
    - The program starts at step 0 and finishes at step 119.
