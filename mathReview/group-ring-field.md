# Group

**A Group, (G, ) is a nonempty set G together with a binary operation \* on G such that the following conditions hold: **

- Closure: For all a, b ∈ G the element a + b ∈ G
- Inverse: Each has an additive inverse
- Associativity: For all a, b, c ∈ G, we have a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
- Identity: There exists an identity element e ∈ G such that, a + 0 = a, and, a + 0 = a, for all a ∈ G

# Ring

**Let R be a set on which two binary operations are fdefined, called addition and multiplication, and denoted by + and \***

- _Addition_

- Closure: For all a, b ∈ G the element a + b ∈ G
- Inverse: Each has an additive inverse
- Associativity: For all a, b, c ∈ G, we have a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
- Identity: There exists an identity element e ∈ G such that, a + 0 = a, and, a + 0 = a, for all a ∈ G

- _Multiplication_

- Associative: a _ (b _ c) = (a _ b) _ c
- No need for a ring to be communtatuve
- No need for it to have multiplication inverses
- Distributive: a _ (b + c) = a _ b + a _ c and (a + b) _ c = a _ c + b _ c
  _Ring Examples_
  Z, R, amd C are all examples of rings with identity however a 2 X 3 matrix is a group but not a ring.
