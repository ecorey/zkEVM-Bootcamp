# Homework 4

**_Some modular arithmetic_**

**Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
What is:**

- 4 + 4

  8 ∉ S
  so
  (4 + 4) ∉ S

- 3 x 5

  15 ∉ S
  so
  (3 X 5) ∉ S

**What is the inverse of 3 under:**

- addition

  The addition inverse of a number is what you would add to the number to get zero as a result.

  answer: −3

  3 + (−3) = 0

- multiplication

  The addition inverse of a number is what you would add to the number to get one as a result.
  For any nonzero number x, its multiplicative inverse is 1/x

  answer: 3

  3 × (1/3) = 1

**For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}**
**Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?**

In order to see if a set with an operation, like addition forms a group, we need to check if it has the four properties of a group. These properties are:

- Closure: For every pair of elements a and b in S, the result of the operation a + b must also be in S.

- Associativity: For every a,b and c in S, the equation (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) must be true.

- Identity Element: There must be an element e in S such that for every element a in S, the equation e + a = a + e = a is true.

- Inverse Element: For every element a in S, there must be an element b in S such that a + b = b + a = e where e is the identity element.

ANSWER:
False
Closure property is not true. For example, 4 + 4 = 8 and 8 is not in the set S.

**What is:**

- 13 mod 5

  13 mod 5 = 3
  13 ÷ 5 = 2 R3

**Polynomials**

- For the polynomial x^3 − x^2 + 4x − 12 Find a positive root.

  The positive root of a polynomial is a value for the variable, usually x that makes the polynomial equal to zero, and the value itself is also greater than zero.

- What is the degree of this polynomial

  The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial which in this case is found in the x^3, so the answer is 3.
