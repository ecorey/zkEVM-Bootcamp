# Homework 3

**zkEVM Set Up Environment**

_In preparation for the development tasks we will be doing, we need to
setup a development environment._

For Windows users :

- it may be best to use WSL2.

For all users : if you have problems with installing any of the projects, I
advise you to use a codespace on the bootcamp repo

- Install the Rust toolchain
  See Instructions
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf
  https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

**Zustlings for zkEVM**
We have some Rust exercises for you to work through
These are in the bootcamp [repo](https://github.com/ExtropyIO/zkEVMBootcamp):

You can either clone this locally or set up a codespace
WIndows users
It may help to use WSL, or if you still have problems we suggest using a
codespace as above.

**Installing Zustlings**
. Make sure you have rust installed
. In the rust directory run
cargo install --force --path .
